Feature: Block page
  Scenario: should show title, summary, and transactions
    Given I'm on page "/block/6524861224470851795"
    Then I should see "Block  6524861224470851795" in "h1" html element
    And I should see table "summary" containing:
      | Transactions  |	103                  |
      | Confirmations |	12425                |
